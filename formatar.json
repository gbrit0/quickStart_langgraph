At its core, LangGraph uses the power of graph-based architectures to model and manage the intricate relationships between various components of an [AI agent workflow](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-agents). LangGraph is also built on several key technologies, including [LangChain,](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/langchain) a Python framework for building AI applications. By combining these technologies with a set of APIs and tools, LangGraph provides users with a versatile platform for developing AI solutions and workflows including [chatbots](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/chatbots), state graphs and [other agent-based systems](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/multiagent-system).",
